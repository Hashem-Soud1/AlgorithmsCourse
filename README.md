# Project: Factorial Calculation Comparison

This project explores two C++ implementations for calculating factorials: recursive and iterative methods. The primary goal is to compare their performance.

## Factorial Calculation Methods :

 ### 1-Recursive Approach

The `fact_rec` function utilizes a recursive approach to compute factorials.

### 2-Iterative Approach

The `fact_iter` function employs an iterative method for factorial calculation.

## Performance Evaluation :

The project measures the execution time of both methods using the `<chrono>` library.

## Results

The output displays the time taken by each method for computing factorial.
Based on the performance results, analyze and discuss the efficiency of each method.
